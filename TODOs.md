# TODO:

### App tool
- publish beta of v3.1s
  - remove dark theme colors from tokens export?
  - update readme
    - a dark color cannot link to its light counterpart or there will be a circular dependency
    - crazy css switching scheme
    - importing a css file in scss with the .css suffix will break the style because it adds a css partial
    - create-react-app hot reload with theme switching does some weird things sometimes
    - how to consume libs and customize
    - how branching works
    - how copying works
    - how versioning works
- change project name to blueprintjs-styler ... add js because thats how its named?
- v4 - wait until a beta from blueprintjs
- CSS Build?
  - separate different packages on build - core, selection, table, etc...
  - provide non-fallback version of css?
  - export a font file
- sections:
  - for each theme: add a readme to each project - default styles is project explainer
  - base theme component that imports scss files
  - custom components
  - colors
  - typography
- Navigation
  - maybe we can only use params due to the `"homepage": "."` thing with create-react-app
  - search
  - shortcut keys
  - routing? to specific themes
  - title navigation link buttons on hovers
  - nav bar stays in sync with scroll position
- Custom theme editor
  - vars editing
  - make a custom theme export it
- js generator of color vars - [hsluv](https://www.hsluv.org/)!
- Themes are individually published packages - with font dependencies? - monorepo?
  - Add a dependency on the core repo,
  - Generate new style: `$ npm run new-style <style-name>`
  - build it and publish it under `@blueprintjs-style/<style-name>`
