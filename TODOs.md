# TODO:

### App tool
- update readmes
  - a dark color cannot link to its light counterpart or there will be a circular dependency
- switch to create-react-app
  - create build for libs
  - repair examples - include new ones...
  - does create react app accept the null deletion? probably not...
  - antd and default are broken due to svg-icon()
- CSS Build?
  - separate different packages on build - core, selection, table, etc...
  - provide no minified?
  - provide non-fallback version of css?
  - remove the need for the property:null delection strategy
