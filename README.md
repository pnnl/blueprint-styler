# Blueprint Styler

This project is meant to help create custom styles for [Blueprint js Components](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/)

## Quick start

From the root of the repo:

1. Run `npm i`
1. Run `npm start`
1. Open your browser to http://localhost:9000/

*Note: if you want to run the development server on a different port, set the `PORT` environment variable.*
