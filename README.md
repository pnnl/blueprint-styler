# Blueprint Styler

This project is meant to help create custom global styles for [Blueprint js Components](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/)

(Project Demo)[https://stash.pnnl.gov/pages/UXRSRC/blueprint-styler/master/browse/dist/index.html]

## Quick start

From the root of the repo:

1. Run `npm i`
1. Run `npm start`
1. Open your browser to http://localhost:9000/

*Note: if you want to run the development server on a different port, set the `PORT` environment variable.*


## TODOS:
- better js outputs - split colors and stuff
- save state between loads
- make search work
- add shortcut keys
- add components from other projects??
- rename everything to "styler"
- add a readme to each project
- `$ npm run new-style <style-name>` generates a new style
- `$ npm run publish <style-name>` publish a lib to npm under `@blueprint-style/<style-name>`
- directions
